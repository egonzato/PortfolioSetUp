    Hi! My name is Elia Gonzato <br>
    PhD Candidate Biostatistics @AUMC, @Decision Modelling Centre <br>
    I am a PhD Candidate in Biostatistics at Amsterdam University Medical Centre. I graduated in Biostatistics from University of Milano Bicocca, during which I took part in a hackathon organized by SAS were I was awarded the runner-up prize. I worked on my master thesis at Karolinska Institutet. I worked as a junior researcher at Erasmus University Medical Center at the Department of Public Health. I am now affiliated with Amsterdam Leukodystrophy Center, within Emma Children's Hospital, and the Department of Epidemiology and Data Science.
    My research focuses on improving clinical trials designs and statistical tools in ultra-rare diseases, where the availability of patients is constrained and the heterogeneity to study very wide. To improve the available methods and give my contribution to the field I am diving into causal inference and Bayesian statistics.
